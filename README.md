# Pathfinding-Visualisation
This is my first attempt at creating a visual path-finding algorithm in Javascript (Node.js and p5.js) which allows the user to interact.

## Information
__A* Search__: Considered to be the best pathfinding algorithm. This is the only algorithm used so far, but future updates will allow the user to choose an algorithm of their choice, and compare their methods.

Walls can be added or removed manually to create a custom maze for the algorithm to work through. Start and end nodes are preset to the top-left and bottom-right corners accordingly, but a newer version will see these adjustable by the user. Once ready to run, you can click the start button.

Once finished, the top-right corner will clarify the outcome of the pathfinder.

## Features
__Auto-Sizing__: The grid auto-configures to the window dimensions of the user. Cells remain the same size, but the number of rows and columns adjust accordingly.
